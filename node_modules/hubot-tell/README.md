hubot-tell
==========

Hubot plugin to send a user a message the next time they are present in the room

Installation
------------

Add **hubot-tell** to your `package.json` file:

```javascript
"dependencies": {
  "hubot": ">= 2.5.1",
  "hubot-tell": "*"
}
```

Add **hubot-tell** to your `external-scripts.json`:

```javascript
["hubot-tell"]
```

Run `npm install`

Usage
-----

Assuming your hubot instance is called `hubot`, you can instruct it to relay a message as follows:

`hubot: tell <recipients> <message>`

The message will then be stored and relayed to the recipient(s) as soon as they enter the room. You can specifiy a comma-separated list to send your message to multiple users.

Case-insensitive prefix matching is used to match the recipients' nicknames. That way, you can make sure that your message will reach its destination, even if the recipient has a different nickname suffix. If you send a message to `foo`, and `foo1` joins the room, the message will be delivered to them.

If your hubot has a persistent brain (e.g. with redis), messages will be preserved there even if you restart your life embetterment robot.

Configuration
-------------

By default, this script uses absolute timestamps to indicate when a message was sent. If you prefer relative timestamps of the form `2 hours ago` over absolute ones like `Mon Apr 21 2014 10:37:28 GMT+0200 (CEST)`, set the evironment variable `HUBOT_TELL_RELATIVE_TIME`.
